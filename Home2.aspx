    <div class="hit-the-floor">Youth Confessions...!!</div>

    <p><h3>Confess your sins to the priest who stands in persona Christi capitas et spousa. This means we are confessing our sins to Christ Himself. Only God Almighty can forgive our sins. God gave us a special place to encounter Him, to be healed. Why do we need to go to a priest? Why can’t I just tell Christ myself? Good questions. Priests are awesome!

When you get into the confessional, or sit down with a priest, be sure to tell him how long it’s been since your last Confession. Then tell him what sins you would like to confess.

        A confession is a statement - made by a person or by a group of persons - acknowledging some personal fact that the person (or the group) would ostensibly prefer to keep hidden. The term presumes that the speaker is providing information that he believes the other party is not already aware of, and is frequently associated with an admission of a moral or legal wrong.

        In one sense it is the acknowledgment of having done something wrong, whether on purpose or not. Thus confessional texts usually provide information of a private nature previously unavailable. What a sinner tells a priest in the confessional, the documents criminals sign acknowledging what they have done, an autobiography in which the author acknowledges mistakes, and so on, are all examples of confessional texts.

        Not all confessions reveal wrongdoing, however. For example, a confession of love is often considered positive both by the confessor and by the recipient of the confession, and is a common theme in literature. With respect to confessions of wrongdoing, there are several specific kinds of confessions that have significance beyond the social. A legal confession involves an admission of some wrongdoing that has legal consequence, while the concept of confession in religion varies widely across various belief systems, and is usually more akin to a ritual by which the person acknowledges thoughts or actions considered sinful or morally wrong within the confines of the confessor's religion. In some religions, confession takes the form of an oral communication to another person. Socially, however, the term may refer to admissions that are neither legally nor religiously significant.
